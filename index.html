        <h1>Introducing My Site</h1>
        <p>When you understand HTML and CSS at the level I do, it's easy to understand why this page is so janky. Do I feel bad about it? Not really. Do I think I'll be able to do better in the future? Most definitely. I'm not really the kind of person to settle or give up. I enjoy learning and tend to go above and beyond in anything I do. Anyway, I think I should ramble on a while longer, because I want to make sure this paragraph is large enough to fill a decent amount of space. I guess it doesn't really matter what I write here. I could really go for a cheeseburger right now, but this quarantine is making things difficult.</p>
